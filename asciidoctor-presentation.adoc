== What's AsciiDoctor?

[quote, asciidoctor.org]
____
Asciidoctor is a fast text processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to HTML5, DocBook 5 (or 4.5) and other formats
____

As suggested by this quote, it is important to distinguish *AsciiDoc* and *AsciiDoctor*:

* icon:file-text[] AsciiDoc = *lightweigh language*, the "syntax" part
* icon:wrench[] AsciiDoctor = parser + tools

*AsciiDoc* was created in 2002 by Stuart Rackham, and is written in *Python*. +
*AsciiDoctor* was initiated in 2012 by Ryan Waldron and Nick Hengeveld, is currently led by Dan Allen and Sarah White, and is written in *Ruby*.

== Lightweigh languages

As said above, AsciiDoc belongs to the category of the *lightweigh markup languages* (LML). +
As the name implies, those last are *markup* languages, but are intended to be *far less complex and verbose* than HTML and especially XML. +
It is designed to be easy to create with any generic text editor, as well as easy to read in its raw form.

Generally used in *wiki*, we now also find them in common Web tools like *GitHub*, *Jira*, *Redmine*, etc. +
Once the raw format saved, all those tools convert it into HTML for display in the browser.

To my mind, most popular LMLs currently are Markdown and AsciiDoc(tor).

Here is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language[comparison of the principal ones].

== AsciiDoc(tor) syntax

NOTE: AsciiDoc**tor** extends AsciiDoc syntax, adding some features not natively present.

You will find everything you want in the 2 following resources:

* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[the AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]
* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[the User Manual]

Those 2 resouces are really *awesomely well done*, do not hesite to abuse it!

Here is just a small example of the syntax:

[TIP] 
====
Asciidoctor can “draw” icons using http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/[Font Awesome] and CSS, which is just a kick-ass feature! +
Some examples: icon:tags[] icon:car[] icon:cloud-upload[] icon:heartbeat[] icon:fire[]

== AsciiDoctor in GitHub

GitHub *natively* supports AsciiDoctor, meaning you have *nothing* to install on your local desktop emoji:wink[2x]

Just a have a look at some `.adoc` in repos to get some examples, like `README.adoc` or some GitHub wikis. +
As an example, here are some of mines:

* https://github.com/Ardemius/devoxx-france-2015-presentation/blob/master/a-world-where-1ms-is-worth-100ME.adoc
* https://github.com/Ardemius/personal-wiki/wiki/AsciiDoctor-tips

== HubPress: AsciiDoc based blog using GitHub Pages

http://hubpress.io/[HubPress] is a free, open source tool you can use to build a rich, *AsciiDoc based blog using GitHub Pages*.

*Everything can be done through its web interface*, meaning you don't have to install AsciiDoctor on your local desktop. +
Instead of using the HubPress editor, you can also write the raw document on your desktop, and push it to the backing GitHub repo.

The *installation instructions* are rather simple and can be found, with the *documentation*, on the https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io[HubPress GitHub Repo].

Examples:

* http://blog.hubpress.io/[the official HubPress blog]
* https://ardemius.github.io/[my own blog]

== AsciiDoc highlighting for Sublime Text

To add *syntax highlighting* and *snippets* for AsciiDoc to Sublime Text, just follow the instructions at https://github.com/SublimeText/AsciiDoc.

Here is an example of rendering:

image::asciidoc-support-in-sublime-text.PNG[title="AsciiDoc highlighting in Sublime Text"]

[NOTE]
====
From the original repo https://github.com/mrchief/AsciiDoc.SublimeText2, you learn that the AsciiDoctor syntax highlighting works best in Sublime Text with theme *Sunburst* or *Twilight*.
====

== AsciiDoctor in Chrome

Using the extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[Asciidoctor.js Live Preview], *AsciiDoc documents can be rendered as HTML directly in Chrome*, without a prior transformation on your desktop (meaning you don't even need to install AsciiDoctor on your Desktop). +
For your information, this extension uses the `asciidoctor.js` script to perform its rendering.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be sure to have a look to https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-chrome-extension[the extension GitHub repo], and its documentation. +
It warns you about common troubleshooting as the `Allow access to file URLs` option, or the correct way to display a table of content.

== AsciiDoctor and its backends: ONE TOOL TO RENDER THEM ALL!!!!

Here comes the big part, the one where the magic happens emoji:triumph[2x]

From this point, you will have to install AsciiDoctor and its backends on your local desktop. +
First, to install AsciiDoctor, just follow those instructions at this page: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/install-toolchain/

AsciiDoctor has 4 native backends: `html5`, `xhtml5`, `docbook` and `docbook45`. +
Several others exist (`deck.js`, `DZSlides`), that require a complementary install, check https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-backends for more details.

To know how to render a document, check this link http://asciidoctor.org/docs/render-documents/

=== HTML5 rendering

In the directory that contains your .adoc document, just run:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
asciidoctor mysample.adoc
----

=== DocBook rendering

In the directory that contains your .adoc document, just run:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
asciidoctor -b docbook mysample.adoc
----

=== Slides rendering with DZSlides

As DZSlides is not a native backend, it requires a complementary install, which is described here https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-backends/tree/master/slim/dzslides#initial-setup

The 2 main parts of additional backends are:

* the *template directory*: required for the transformation of the .adoc into an HTML document
* the *presentation library*: required for the rendering of the final HTML document

Once done, the render command is the following:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
asciidoctor -T </path/to/asciidoctor-backends> -E slim </path/to/asciidoctor-document>
----

[TIP]
====
To know what http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#role[`role`] are available for DZSlides, have a look at: https://github.com/mojavelinux/dzslides/blob/master/themes/style/asciidoctor.css
